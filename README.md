📝 Best Practices
Organization

Keep a folder of exported skins
Back up custom overlay packs
Design Guidelines
Start simple, add complexity gradually
Test in both Steve and Alex models if unsure
Preview from all angles before exporting
Save before making major changes
Color Theory
Use complementary colors for contrast
Stick to 3-4 main colors per design
Use brightness to create depth
Desaturate shadows, saturate highlights
🆘 Troubleshooting
Problem: Gallery panel won't close

Click the ✕ button in the top-right of the panel
Or click outside the panel
Problem: Layers not showing in preview

Check if layer visibility (👁️) is enabled

Problem: Colors look wrong

Reset color sliders to default (0 or 100%)
Check if color tint is set to white (#ffffff)
Try toggling shading (💡 button)
Problem: Can't upload files

Ensure files are PNG format
Check files are 64x64 pixels
Try uploading one at a time

Problem: Export looks different than preview

Ensure all desired layers are visible (👁️)
Check second layer toggles (🛡️)
